                        "Courtesy, loyalty, integrity, perseverance, self-control, and indomitable spirit; this is what is taught at this studio.

                        These core values are at the heart of Tae Kwon Do and this studio. Its not just about kicks and punches, Master Lee provides a comprehensive education that is first rate. Master Lee's style is a unique blend of strict firmness, yet still nice that only a seasoned Tae Kwon Do master can provide. Its a rare brand of tough love that is exceedingly hard to find these days, perhaps a lost art.

                        "We cannot say enough wonderful things about Campbell Tae Kwon Do Academy. Our son has been going here for about 9 months now. Ever since then he has been steadily gaining confidence, self control and perseverance. Master Lee is one of the best teachers you can get. He is not only a master of Tae Kwon Do, but also knows how to teach kids based on their needs and areas they need to work hard on. As he emphasizes often, the classes are not for just learning the kick and punches &amp; earning higher belts, it's more to become a better and a stronger person in all respects.

                        Despite both my wife's and my crazy work schedules, the main reason we want our son to be at Campbell TKD is because he has made amazing progress and this reflects on his general social-emotional behaviors at school and outside as well. We also appreciate the positive reinforcements and consequence based rewards (best spirit/ best student awards) system that Master Lee practices. This has definitely helped our son to be motivated to aim to achieve more."

                        My son is nine and dealing with being a high functioning autistic child. It is hard for him to take part in organized sports and group activities.  he struggle to keep him socialized and physically active is tough. He requires a lot of attention. The support we have received from the instructors and the parents has been wonderful. I must admit it was not and still is not a mdooth transition to go from antisocial loner, to a group of kids and adults you must acknowledge and address. My son has to listen to Master Lee. If not ready to listen and follow instructions he must sit out. Then the instructor will ask him if he is ready to come back. It is so hard for my son to stand still, yet with the proper praise and discipline he is really thriving. I can not tell you how happy I am with the patience and firm hand both instructors have had with my boy. Without their lead my boy would never be offered this chance. I have asked my son what his favorite part of class is and he said "when everyone claps and cheers for me when I do something right!". I highly recommend this place to any age and temperament.
